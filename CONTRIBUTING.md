Guidelines

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch for your changes.
- Write clear, focused commits and open a pull request describing the change.
- Add tests where reasonable. Keep changes small and well-documented.
- Use black or flake8 for Python formatting (project does not enforce style yet).
